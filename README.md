# A_and_P_site_matrix_analysis_with_7_dataset_at_75_percent_coverage
Translation elongation rate analysis at amino acid, tRNA, and Codon level by ribosome profiling dataset

# Point of action cover in amino acid level analysis
1. 7 ribo-seq data used for this analysis
3. Normalised ribsome density calculated for each gene
5. Statistically significance calculate for each pair at P- and A-site by Mannâ€“Whitney U test
6. Speed define by percentage change
10. The robustness of each pair defines by the two filter criteria. For each pair, All seven dataset percentage change directions should be in the same direction. Any four datasets should show the statistically significant p-value.
14. Created A and P site matrix at amino acid, tRNA, and Codon level
